This game uses HTML, that means it runs on your browser using the files on your computer. To access your save data and properly save your game, connect to the internet.

To run the game, double click the file named “Runner,” running the file named “Runner chap 1-2” will only let you play the first two chapters. I included that option because those are the chapters that are free to the public. The rest of the chapters you would normally need to pay for, so if you are heavy against piracy, use the secondary version.

The controls can not be changed until you reach Ralsei in his castle, until then your controls will be the arrow keys, Enter, Esc, and the spacebar.

Thanks for reading!
